## Additional Tools

I leveraged the [Voiceover](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/guides/add_voiceovers.html) feature provided by Manim and employed a [local AI](https://docs.aihub.wtf) voice overlay on my PC to operate a model of David Attenborough, owing to his distinctive and recognizable voice.
